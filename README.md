# Grover-MathOracle
Mathematical oracle functions in Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm. 
The purpose of this circuit is to showcase the ability of solving more practical search problems by using Grover's Search Algorithm. The example circuit is meant to find x (in the first 3 qubits) from a simple equation X+a=b by using Grover's search algorithm with that equation implemented as it's oracle function.
